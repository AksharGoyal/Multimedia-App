# Stack Up Bounty Challenge - Akshar  

## Features Added

For the bounty challenge, I decided to add a dropdown menu which a visitor can use to select what kind of media they want to see. They can choose to see files of **all** type of media, or just music, for example, by just clicking on the "music" option. By clicking on an option, the app will filter through the files whose type matches the value of the clicked option and show only the filtered files. User can reset the filter by clicking on the "All" option.

I also added a search bar where a visitor can type in to search for the file(s) they are looking for. If we have files such as "ABC.mp3" and "ABCD.pdf", typing "Ab" in the search bar will get me both the files. The search bar will use the value provided as input to search through the files and show the files whose name include the value provided in the search bar.

## Why these features?

My reason for adding these features was to help in narrowing down the list of files to search for particular file(s). In scenarios where we may have 30 or more files, looking for a file may become tedious. The ability to filter out unnecessary files, through regular expression or media type, makes it easy for human to find what they are looking for.
